All your scripts relied on whatever packages you had installed, and now you need to run your scripts, see the billion import errors, and reinstall everything again.  Ugh!  Or, you could have been like Peggy the proficient programmer and used virtual environments, and kept all dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file, and you would have been one command line call away from getting back to the meaningful work of slamming your head against the wall trying to figure out whatever lxml's API call is for stripping out tags but leaving the text.

Well imagine that stew relies on potato v.1.1, and au-gratin relies on potato v 2.1, and the starchiness module introduced in v2.0 is not backwards compatible, making previous versions of potato obselete.  Now you are, via the transitive property or something like that, importing two incompatible versions of potato, and this might result in some wicked Heisen-bugs that are difficult to debug and get in the way of making your partner a nice digital display of food for your anniversary that you've never forgotten.  \n",
